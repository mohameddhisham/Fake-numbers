# Fake-numbers

As a Real Time Analyst, I know that data quality is paramount! ðŸŽ¯ To ensure our agents have the best data possible, I've been working on a project focused on improving the quality of our phone number data. This code is a key part of that effort. It's designed to:

Validate phone numbers, ensuring they adhere to standard formats (like US numbers).

Identify potentially incorrect or fake numbers, preventing our agents from wasting time on bad leads.

Process phone number lists efficiently, handling large files with speed and accuracy.

Preserve all the original data, so we don't lose any valuable context.

The goal of this code is to exclude fake numbers from the files. While the total records excluded may not be a large percentage, this small amount of excluded data still matters.

By implementing this, we're not just cleaning up our data; we're:

Boosting agent productivity by providing them with better leads.

Improving contact rates and overall campaign effectiveness.

Reducing wasted time and resources.

Ensuring compliance with data quality standards.

This is about delivering the best possible data to our agents.
